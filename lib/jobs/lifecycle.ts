// ─── Job status lifecycle — the state machine ─────────────
// Single place that decides how a job moves between statuses and WHO may move it.
//
// Two actor tiers drive the graph:
//   • "field"  — the tech / installer / salesperson on their OWN job (jobs.edit own
//                or all). The real-world steps: en route, working, waiting, done.
//   • "office" — dispatch / managers (jobs.edit = all). Scheduling + billing steps.
//
// On top of the graph, anyone holding the `jobs_status_override` flag (dispatcher,
// managers, admins by default) can force ANY status, bypassing the graph and the
// checklist gate — that's the manual dispatch override. Every change is recorded
// in the job's statusHistory.
//
// Status keys are the canonical keys from Settings → Job Statuses
// (lib/job-config). Agreement visits reuse this exact engine once materialized
// into a job (see dispatchType "agreement_visit").
