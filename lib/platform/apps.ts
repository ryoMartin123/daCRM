// ─── Platform app registry ────────────────────────────────
// The CRM is now ONE app inside a larger business platform. This registry is the
// single source of truth for the apps the platform ships with: their identity,
// entry route, icon, accent, and the app-access flag that gates them.
//
// The CRM keeps its existing root routes (/dashboard, /customers, …). The other
// apps live under their own route prefix (/portal, /hr, …). `currentAppFromPath`
// maps any pathname back to the app it belongs to so the app switcher and shell
// can highlight the active app.
